                        <p>SWT is the process of evaluating a system or its component(s) with the intent to find whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not. In simple words, testing is executing a system in order to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements in contrary to the actual requirements. In the IT industry, large companies have a team with responsibilities to evaluate the developed software in context of the given requirements. Moreover, developers also conduct testing.</p>
                        <p>Note that, Software testers play a major role in the development of software. Testing is performed throughout the SDLC (software Development Lifecycle. There exist various testing methodologies, testing tools and popular testing frameworks. Software testers are responsible for validating the software for production. Tester are sometimes referred to as QA(Quality Assurance) Engineers but while their scope of work may sometimes overlap, there’s a difference in that Software testers work to detect and fix errors, whereas quality assurance assists in preventing any mistakes or issues during the software development process so Quality Assurance is a much wider topic than Testing because it covers more than just the outputs of software delivery (the end product), it also covers the inputs (how the product is being developed), in order to improve the likelihood of a positive outcome. QA therefore encompasses SWT. In This course, you will learn, but not limited to;

So contrary to popular belief, you will find out that Software Testing is not just a single/isolate activity, i.e. testing, but It consists of a series of activities carried out methodologically to help certify a software product.

Manual Software Testing requires more effort but is necessary to check automation feasibility. Manual Testing concepts does not require knowledge of any testing tool.

With each stage of development, we’re going to look at corresponding test levels that go with it and activities and deliverables. Also, we’ll look at how to generate testcases and overall test suites for maximum test coverage.

Note that it is not required for a software tester to master all of these different testing types, because not all testing types are applicable to all projects but depend on the nature & scope of the project.
