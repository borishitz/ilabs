                                Taking the first steps as you start building on the cloud can seem overwhelming. Adjusting to a
                                cloud-native approach can take time, especially if you are accustomed to the traditional on-premises
                                way of provisioning hardware and building applications. Gaining familiarity with core concepts of
                                cloud computing and the AWS Cloud will help give you confidence as you begin your cloud journey.
                                In the following sections, we answer common questions about cloud computing and explore best practices
                                for building on AWS. Define the AWS Cloud and its value proposition, Identify aspects of AWS Cloud economics.
                                Be able to list the different cloud architecture design principles such as Reasonable Deployment,
                                Business Continuity, Elastic Expansion, Performance Efficiency and Security Compliance.

                        <p>Cloud security is a collection of procedures and technology designed to address external and internal
                            threats to business security. Organizations need cloud security as they move toward their digital
                            transformation strategy and incorporate cloud-based tools and services as part of their infrastructure. </p>
                        <p>The AWS shared responsibility model is a concept of dividing responsibilities between AWS and a Customer.
                            The Customer is you. AWS's responsibilities are the security of the cloud.</p>
                        <p>Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority. AWS cloud allows customers to scale and innovate, while
                            maintaining a secure environment. </p>

                                Identity and Access Management (IAM): IAM is a web service that allows users to manage access to AWS resources. With IAM, users can create and manage users and groups, assign permissions and policies, and set up multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security to their AWS accounts.
                            </li>

                                AWS Single Sign-On (SSO): AWS SSO is a cloud-based service that makes it easy to manage access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications. With AWS SSO, users can centrally manage access to AWS accounts, as well as other third-party applications and services.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                AWS Organizations: AWS Organizations is a service that allows users to centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts. With AWS Organizations, users can create and manage accounts, apply policies and controls across accounts, and simplify billing and cost management.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Resource-level permissions: AWS allows users to set granular permissions for specific AWS resources, such as EC2 instances or S3 buckets. This helps ensure that only authorized users can access and modify these resources.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                AWS Security Token Service (STS): STS is a web service that enables users to generate temporary security credentials that can be used to access AWS resources. These temporary credentials can be used by applications or users who need access to AWS resources for a short period of time, without requiring the use of long-term credentials.
                            </li>
